    <Description value="Adding additional shapes for the wood frame: pillar100, pillar50, short and tall pyramid, wedge tip, pole, center pole, pillar100 cap (or hemisphere), and plate.  In version 3.3 I added semi-proper icons for the shape variant menu and hopefully all upgrade paths should work properly.  Happy building!"/>
