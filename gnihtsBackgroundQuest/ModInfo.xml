    <Description value="This modlet introduces 'backgrounds' to represent who the survivor was before the apocalypse.  The benefits are meant to be relatively small, yet meaningful.  This quest also gives the 4 skill points that would normally come from the starter quest, because starting with these points at the very beginning helps represent them being from character background. I assume players are familiar enough with the game they don't need the tutorial, and only prompt a player to make and place a bedroll."/>
